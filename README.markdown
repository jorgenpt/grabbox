Simple screenshot sharing for Mac
=================================

GrabBox is a utility that reacts to the screenshots you take. It automatically
copies the screenshots to your Dropbox Public folder, and then copies the URL
to the clipboard – ready to share with friends or strangers!

Just start GrabBox and then take a screenshot like normal (Shift-Command-3 or
Shift-Command-4 and select). GrabBox takes care of the rest!

How is GrabBox different from similar tools?

GrabBox offers:

- Free hosting (via Dropbox) with no ads.
- Direct links to the image file itself, no silly interstitial pages.
- Focus on simplicity and “do one thing right”.
- Automatically resize Retina screenshots.
- All GrabBox requires is a Dropbox account (free!).
- Open source!

So, what are you waiting for?
